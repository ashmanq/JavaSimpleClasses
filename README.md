# Java Simple Classes

A simple Java App that tests the functionality of three classes; Calculator, Printer and WaterBottle. The aim was to practice creating and manipulating simple classes in the Java programming language. The app was produced using TDD principles. It carries out the following:

* Has a calculator class that carries out add, subtract, multiply and divide operations on two integers.
* Has a water bottle class that contains a volume and has functions to empty bottle, drink from bottle and refill bottle.
* Has a printer class that has a number of papers and is able to print while it has toner and paper available.
